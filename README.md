Assessment of TCFD voluntary disclosure compliance in the Spanish energy sector: A text mining approach to climate change financial disclosures.
It is pending publication in MDPI's World magazine. (March 2025)

üìå General description: 
This study investigates the voluntary implementation of the Task Force on Cli-mate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in 64 annual sustainability re-ports (2020-2023) of six Spanish energy companies listed on IBEX-35. The methodology includes advanced text mining (TM) techniques, such as named entity recognition (NER) and full-text searches (FTS), to ensure a comprehensive analysis. We evaluated the 11 recommended disclosures to assess their quality, extent, and relevance, as well as 70 specific concepts based on TM analyses and previous report evaluations, to con-struct an index of TCFD compliance. The results show year-on-year improvements in compliance with the TCFD. The TM technique reveals that Iberdrola and Repsol lead governance and risk disclosure, whereas Enag√°s and REE show inconsistencies in re-silience and emissions, posing reputational risks. Significant progress has been made in 11 aspects of reporting quality, scope, and relevance to stakeholders. The index shows disclosure inequality for 70 specific concepts. The conclusions are that the energy sec-tor drives political-social change against climate change, progress in opportunities and challenges remains, and reinforces the need for mandatory climate financial reporting standards. Future research will analyze the TCFD framework to assess intangible business assets and the impact of regulatory implementation on sustainability reports using TM. The originality, implications, and empirical evidence provide a multidisci-plinary perspective using text mining, revealing key patterns, and promoting trans-parency for stakeholders.
